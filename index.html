<br/><br/><h2><b>WRITING </b></h2>
<img src='image.png' width='400px'; height='200px;'><br/>
Writing is the representation of sound and speech in meaningful form and in graphic form on
papyrus, stone, vellum or parchment, or on similar objects. Through the alphabet, we make a
combination of letters to spell out every sound that we make when speaking

<br/><br/><h2><b>THE BEGINNING OF WRITING </b></h2>
5.Humankind is endowed with a language by his creator. Humankind in Mesopotamia probably
agreed upon a conventional method of records of temple activities in written signs that should
be intelligle to all their colleagues and successors. They thus invented writing. Thus, writing
came about as a result of humankindâ€™s need to aid his memory, to maintain his civilization and
to have a permanent means of keeping records.
FORMS OF WRITING
1. Picture writing/Hieroglyph: Picture writing is simply the use of symbols to denote words.
Humankind communicated his ideas through drawing and painting them. Ancient
Egyptians practiced picture writing over six thousand years ago. Their writing was called
hieroglyph or holy engraving or sacred writing.
2. Cuneiform Writing: cuneiform is written by impressing wedge-shaped pen or stylus into
tablets of soft clay. This method of writing was in use by the Sumerians, Babylonians,
Assyrians and Persians from around 3000 B.C. until sometime after 500 B.C. when it was
abandoned in favour of alphabet writing on papyrus.
3. The Alphabet: the alphabet writing in current use came to us through Latin and Greek script
through the Phoenician script. A 32 letter alphabet based upon a simplified cuneiform, was
found in Ugarit in the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C. Phoenicia is the Greek name for
land of Canaanites (modern Lebanon). The Phoenicians invented alphabetic writing in the
second millennium B.C. the Greek borrowed these Canaanites scripts and adapted certain
of the signs into vowel signs at about 800 B.C. It subsequently spread all over the world.
